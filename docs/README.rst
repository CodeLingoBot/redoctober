How Red October works
=====================

This is a roadmap to the docs here that cover Red October's design and
how it works internally.

Start with ``model.rst`` for an overview of the Red October model.

The ``delegation.rst`` [1]_ file discusses delegations, which is the
mechanism by which Red October does decryption.

The ``passvault.rst`` file discusses the user vault and user records.

The mechanics of encryption and decryption are covered in the
``cryptor.rst`` file.


.. [1] TODO.
